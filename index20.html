            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
            <p>The website for Abbey Cat Adoptions is currently not efficient to use and could use an update. A more professional look and feel would help the organization attract more support and find homes for the cats they have rescued.
                Specific issues include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Insufficient contrast with grey text on pale yellow background - fails required contrast ratios for accessibility</li>
                <li>Need for reorganization of website to improve navigation</li>
                <li>Website is not responsive for mobile</li>
                <li>Long application form for cat adoption</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="problemStatement textContent solution">
            <h3>The Solution:</h3>
            <p>
                During interviews and surveys, we discovered that users are interested in supporting local cat adoption organizations by adopting a cat. They need an efficient and easy way to find their ideal potential pet. However, Abbeycats.com currently provides users with an overwhelming amount of information which often can’t be filtered.
                We believe that users require a more organized and accessible way of finding out about the cats at Abbey Cat Adoptions. We might help if we streamlined the process of finding a cat and improving the application process for adoption.
                By reorganizing information and making the calls to action on the website, such as adoption or making donations, clear and accessible will not only allow our users to support Abbey Cat Adoptions but also help them adopt a cat faster.</p>

    <section class="researchSection">
        <div class="textContent research">
            <h3>Research</h3>
            <p>Research methodology consisted of interviews with 5 people, 
                followed by a Google Docs online survey of 33 respondents 
                to learn about how people would approach the cat adoption
                process. We explained to respondents that we are trying to 
                improve the design of an existing website and we’d like to 
                understand some of the needs and pain points, wants and desires
                of people who are interested in cat adoption and animal welfare in general.
            </p>
            <p>
                We also conducted a competitor analysis of three other animal rescue agencies to compare
                features, strengths and weaknesses of other websites.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the interviews, we showed respondents the <a href="www.abbeycats.org">www.abbeycats.org</a> website to get their initial impression of the organization. In the online survey we included a screenshot of the website so respondents wouldn’t need to navigate away from the survey to see the page.

                <li>Covering costs of generally running the organization</li>
                <li>Managing to keep up with the amount of cats that are given up</li>
            </ul>
            <p>They need an efficient way to find volunteers and funding to keep their 
                program running. They need a website that will function to maximize donations, 
                streamline the adoption/fostering process, and provide information to potential 
                clients and volunteers.</p>

            <p>We decided to filter out some unusual questions and reorganized the rest into four separate pages. A progress bar that indecates where the user is really helps users to reduce uncertainty. As well, we added the Micro-interaction design to make the application process stress-free.</p>

            <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
            <p>User testing was done to see if the user can access the available cats page and narrow down
                results using a filter. Next step was for the user to go through the adoption process for a cat by
                filling out a form and reaching the confirmation page. After the confirmation page, users were
                asked to return to the home page.</p>
            <p>Based on user testing, we broke up the form into single columns on multiple pages, instead of
                two columns. We modified the progress bar on the multi-page form to improve visibility of
                system status and let applicants know how far they are in the process. We also added colour
                to text fields when completed, and a ‘peeking cat micro-animation’ on each page to add
                delight to an otherwise tedious application process.</p>
            <p> We also modified the way the cat’s information appeared on its page, included a photo
                gallery and a share to social media button.</p>

Increasing engagement through sending newsletters is an audience retention strategy that may strengthen the relationship with the organization and prompt site visitors to provide support.</p>
            <p>A quick and easy process for users to make donations, and additional payment options will increase the likelihood of receiving more financial support from the public.</p>
            <p>The following features are under consideration to improve the overall user experience:</p>
            <ul>
