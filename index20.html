            Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting 
            industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever 
            since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and 
            scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five 
            centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining 
            essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release 
            of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently  
            with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including 
            versions of Lorem Ipsum.

            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
            <p>The website for Abbey Cat Adoptions is currently not efficient to use and could use an update. A more professional look and feel would help the organization attract more support and find homes for the cats they have rescued.
                Specific issues include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Insufficient contrast with grey text on pale yellow background - fails required contrast ratios for accessibility</li>
                <li>Need for reorganization of website to improve navigation</li>
                <li>Website is not responsive for mobile</li>
                <li>Long application form for cat adoption</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="problemStatement textContent solution">
            <h3>The Solution:</h3>
            <p>
                During interviews and surveys, we discovered that users are interested in supporting local cat adoption organizations by adopting a cat. They need an efficient and easy way to find their ideal potential pet. However, Abbeycats.com currently provides users with an overwhelming amount of information which often canâ€™t be filtered.
                We believe that users require a more organized and accessible way of finding out about the cats at Abbey Cat Adoptions. We might help if we streamlined the process of finding a cat and improving the application process for adoption.
                By reorganizing information and making the calls to action on the website, such as adoption or making donations, clear and accessible will not only allow our users to support Abbey Cat Adoptions but also help them adopt a cat faster.</p>
